Heart disease is among the top single causes of death worldwide; thus, the need for its early detection and intervention cannot be overestimated. This report presents a study developed with machine learning techniques on the Heart Disease Prediction System that analyzes individual risk profiles. In this study, accuracies as high as 91% have been achieved by using algorithms like Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting on the UCI Heart Disease Dataset. Further, the system is extended by implementing a Flask-based web interface that is allowed to interactively present the user with predictions and suggestions for personalized recommendations. It features different preprocessing of data, feature selections, and evaluation strategies with a view to ensuring robustness and the reliability of results. The different visualizations-features' importance chart, and ROC chart-offer better insights regarding model performance and decision-making processes. Obtained results are agreed upon by the current application of machine learning approaches toward risk assessment and extend the scientific corpus pertaining to the predictive analytics in the healthcare sector.
